# Contributing (F8TF Lite)

## Goal
Keep examples minimal, runnable, and technology-neutral (functions first).

## Structure
- web/ : minimal Web pipeline examples
- data/ : minimal Data pipeline examples
- docs/ : simplified diagrams and notes (Lite)

## Rules
- no secrets
- no large binaries
- prefer small, readable code
- each example should include a short "How to run"
